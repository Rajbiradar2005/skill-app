Description
The Skill Service App is a platform where people offering services can get in touch; it was done in React. Users can sign up, show their skills, and search for others who provide the services needed. The App includes secure authentication using Firebase, data stored in real time with Firestore, and it's modern, responsively designed. Profiles showcase names, emails, offered services, and bios, thus letting users explore and discover potential matching of skills. The app will make sure that trading skills in will be smooth and efficient, built with React, Firebase Authentication, and Firestore.


Challenges:
1. Challenge 1: Faced the problem of immediate updating of Firebase authentication after a user had logged in.
   - Solution (if found): Solved it by using Firebase Auth persistence to ensure that the state of  
      the user's login was preserved on page reloads and reflected properly.
2. Challenge 2: Firestore data was not showing up properly in the Browse page; it neither sorted nor paginated anything.
   - Solution (if found): Used Firestore's querying features for sorting and pagination data. Now,    
   the browsing page is well-structured, showing user preferences neat and without issues.
